# World Editor with Advanced Terrain Generation (Beta)

## 🌎 Overview
A powerful world editor with procedural terrain generation capabilities, designed to create diverse and realistic landscapes. Currently in beta development.

## 🏔️ Terrain Generation Features

### Biome System
- Plains
- Forests
- Deserts
- Savanna
- Ocean
- Custom biome transitions with smooth blending

### Terrain Features
- Natural rocky formations with cobblestone outcrops
- Varied elevation with hills and valleys
- Cave systems and underground structures
- Rivers and lakes with natural pooling
- Snow-capped mountain ranges
- Natural beaches and shorelines

### Surface Features
- Realistic tree placement with varying densities per biome
- Natural grass and vegetation distribution
- Desert structures and sandstone formations
- Ore deposits (coal, iron, gold, diamond, emerald)

### Customization Options
- Seed-based generation for reproducible worlds
- Adjustable terrain parameters:
  - Mountain height
  - Water level
  - Cave density
  - Biome size
  - Terrain flatness
  - Ore distribution
  - Rock formation frequency
